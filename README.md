# Process-Mining

Experiments with PM4py, the python library for process mining. 

## Repo contains two notebooks:

**1. PM4py-2:**

- demonstration of the basic methods available in the [PM4py library](https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de/)
  
**2. Incident Log Analysis - A Case In Point with PM4py and EventPad**
    
- this notebook is a draft for an article. Using [this dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Incident+management+process+enriched+event+log) we compare PM4py and [Event Pad](https://www.event-pad.com/) as tools for process mining and process analysis. 

## How to run: 
**1. PM4py-2:**

- download notebook and import in Google Colab/Azure Notebooks/Jupiter
- download data file (192.168.210.45.csv)
- change path to data file:
  - `path_to_log = 'local/yourfolder/192.168.210.45.csv'`
- run the cells in the notebook in a consecutive order.

**2. Incident Log Analysis - A Case In Point with PM4py and EventPad**
- this is text only. [You can browse the dataset here.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Incident+management+process+enriched+event+log)
